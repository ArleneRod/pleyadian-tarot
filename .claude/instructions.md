# Claude Instructions for Pleyadian Tarot

## Git Configuration

### Branch Naming
- All feature branches should use the prefix `feature/`
- Format: `feature/description-of-feature`
- Example: `feature/add-tarot-reading-api`

### Commit Messages
- Do NOT include "generated by claude" or any AI attribution in commit messages
- Use conventional commit format when appropriate (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Keep messages clear, concise, and descriptive
- Focus on the "why" rather than the "what"

## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branches with `feature/` prefix
2. Make atomic commits with clear messages
3. Push changes when requested
4. Create pull requests when features are complete
